<h2> Top 3 mixed collection </h2>

<hr />

<h3>One piece</h3>
<p> Favorite anime of all time, all around great show, good power scale and I haven't laughed at an anime as much as this one, very layered as well</p>

<h3>Top Boy</h3> 
<p> Very dark show, loved the choices they made
  when it came to characters, you could tell they weren't afraid to get rid of characters even if they were really liked by the viewers all for the sake of being realistic which I highly respeected
</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p> Really enjoyed the animation, especially 
  in the later series as it's pure insanity. Good story, unique anime with good character development among different people
